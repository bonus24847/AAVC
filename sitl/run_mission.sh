# ── the aircraft's own infrastructure, brought up by the SAME button ───────
# Until 2026-08-18 this script started ONLY the orchestrator, which then
# connects to udpin://…:14540 — a port that exists only because mavlink-router
# is running. Nothing in the 🚀 path started the router, the camera grabber or
# the status beacon; they were started by hand over ssh. On a CM4 that has
# rebooted at the field (a battery swap is enough) pressing 🚀 therefore spawned
# an orchestrator that logged one line — "connecting to udpin://0.0.0.0:14540" —
# and died with no MAVLink, no audit trail and nothing on the operator's screen
# to say why. Seen live at 14:33 on 2026-08-18. The operator cannot ssh in
# during a scored round, so the button has to be self-sufficient.
#
# Idempotent: anything already running is left exactly as it is. Detached with
# setsid so it OUTLIVES this script — that matters most when the mission refuses
# to launch, because the beacon is what carries the refusal ("swap the pack") to
# the console over the radio. Killing it with the mission would hide the answer.
